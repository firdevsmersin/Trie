# Trie-Python
In this project, there is implemention of an application, in Python; that takes a set of text
files as input. The files shall be in a folder, of which the path is taken from the user.
The program will preprocess the given text files and answer the queries accordingly. The
program is not  case-sensitive, e.g., for a query including “data”, it should also give
output for the word “Data”.

The queries can be:
• Which files include words starting with “xyz”. Output shall also include the positions
(i.e., the character number) of the given word in the corresponding files.
• What are the common word(s) in the files “f1”, “f2”, and “f3”?
